## About the Project
This project is a sorting algorithms visualizer website that allows users to see how different sorting algorithms work on an array of numbers. It provides visual and interactive representations of the sorting process, making it easy for users to understand and compare the algorithms' behavior.

## Navigating the Repository
The repository is organized as a standard React application, with the `src` directory containing the main application code. Key folders and files include:

- `src/components`: Contains the individual components used in the application, such as the algorithm visualizations and control panel.
- `src/context`: Houses the global context used in the application for managing state.
- `src/App.js`: The main application component that ties everything together.

## List of Sorting Algorithms
- [Bubble Sort](#bubble-sort)
- [Merge Sort](#merge-sort)
- [Insertion Sort](#insertion-sort)
- [Selection Sort](#selection-sort)
- [Shell Sort](#shell-sort)
- [Heap Sort](#heap-sort)
- [Quick Sort](#quick-sort)

## Developer Guidelines
### Project Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

### Testing
Unit tests are not currently included in the project. If you wish to add tests, consider using a testing library such as Jest, and follow its guidelines for creating and running tests.

### Building and Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` to create a production build of the application.
2. Deploy the application to your desired platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.). Follow the platform's documentation for specific deployment steps.

### Creating the Link for the Installed Project
Once you have deployed the application, you will receive a link to the live project. Update the `README.md` file to include the new link in the "Live Demo" section.

### Version Control
Future enhancements and bug fixes will be handled through the standard Git version control process. Developers should create feature branches for new additions, and use pull requests to merge code into the main branch. Issues can be tracked and discussed in the repository's "Issues" tab.

## How to Run the Project
After visiting the [live demo](https://furs1da.github.io/SortingAlgosReact/), users can interact with the website to select and visualize different sorting algorithms. The controls on the website allow users to generate a new array of numbers, adjust the speed of the visualization, and start or pause the sorting process.

## Learned Things
During the development of this project, I have learned or enhanced my knowledge on the following topics:

- Sorting algorithms
- [Using async/await](#using-async-await)
- [Using recursive functions](#using-recursive-functions)
- [Using React Hooks](#using-react-hooks)
- [Using global context in a React App](#using-global-context-in-a-react-app)
- [Using Lotties (animated files)](#using-lotties-animated-files)
- [Using React UI instruments](#using-react-ui-instruments)
- [How objects and functions are stored in the memory in React](#how-objects-and-functions-are-stored-in-the-memory-in-react)
- [Difference between shallow and deep copy in JavaScript](#difference-between-shallow-and-deep-copy-in-javascript)
- [Deploying React Application to Github Pages](#deploying-react-application-to-github-pages)

By working on this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how sorting algorithms work and how to implement them in a visually appealing way. Additionally, I have become more familiar with various React concepts and libraries, which has improved my overall React development skills.
